# Lab 12 - Getting Graphical with Processing

## What this lab gets you

* You'll get to do something a bit more visual by kicking the tires on Processing, a "flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts". (Quote taken from the [Processing website](https://processing.org/).) Processing is based on the Java language, so you should feel right at home. 
* Lest you think Processing is just some kind of lame toy language, take some time to look at some of the very cool stuff that was created with (or whose creation was aided by) Processing at the [curated exhibition page](https://processing.org/exhibition/) - some of the older links may be dead and some pages are not in English...because Processing is used throughout the world!

## Getting Ready

We have Processing installed in our labs (including B107 and B103); if you want to install it on your own machine, it is freely available on the Processing website. 

1. Start Processing on your machine.
    You can skip the Welcome screen.![Image](screen.PNG?raw=true) 

        What you should see is a Processing sketch window. This is your code editor.

        You should also see a "play" arrow button.
1. Using processing is meant to be pretty simple - type your code into the editor and press play!

        Let's give you something to do!

## Processing Practice - Coordinate System and Shapes

1. Got to https://processing.org/tutorials/
1. Start the _Coordinate System and Shapes_ tutorial
1. Draw yourself some points, lines, rectangles, and ellipses - for the rectangles and ellipses, make sure you try the different modes (CENTER, CORNER, and CORNERS)
1. You can save your sketchbook if you wish through the File menu - make sure you choose a reasonable save location, as the default location is NOT reasonable!

## Processing Practice - Color

1. Got to https://processing.org/tutorials/
1. Start the _Interactivity_ tutorial
1. Draw yourself some **colored** points, lines, rectangles, and ellipses - for the rectangles and ellipses, make sure you create shapes with different fills and strokes.
1. You can save your sketchbook if you wish through the File menu - make sure you choose a reasonable save location, as the default location is NOT reasonable!
